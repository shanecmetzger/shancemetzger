## Intro
I'm Shane, business intelligence and analytics engineer - really, just whatever hat I'm asked to wear each morning. The "hat" requires transitioning data from production systems into data warehouses to restructure and contextualize each dataset. Those datasets are used in reporting instances for clients and stakeholders through dashboards, emails, and Excel reports.
